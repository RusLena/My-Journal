- Viewing Journal Entries: Allows users to view the full content of a journal entry and provides options to edit or delete it.
- Creating a New Journal Entry: Provides a form for users to input the title and content of a new entry, which is then added to the list of entries on the homepage.
- Deleting a Journal Entry: Allows users to delete a journal entry, removing it from the list of entries on the homepage.
- Data Persistence: Saves journal entries locally in the browser's storage for easy access, even after closing the website.
