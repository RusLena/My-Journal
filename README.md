# Personal Website 

# Updates

This project was initially created as part of a group bootcamp assignment. I forked the original repository and rewrote the code for all pages to improve consistency across the application. Additionally, I enhanced the functionality of the entry forms, adding new features to make the user experience smoother and more intuitive.
Key Updates:

    Refactored and redesigned all pages to create a more cohesive look and feel.
    Improved entry forms by adding extra functionality, such as better validation and user interactions.
    Updated styling and backgrounds to align with a more modern and clean design.

## Description

This is a simple web application designed to help users keep track of their daily thoughts and experiences by allowing them to create and manage journal entries. Users can view their entries, create new ones, edit existing ones, and delete entries they no longer need.

**Features of Personal Website:**

- Homepage: Displays a list of journal entries with titles, dates, and previews of content.
- Viewing Journal Entries: Allows users to view the full content of a journal entry and provides options to edit or delete it.
- Creating a New Journal Entry: Provides a form for users to input the title and content of a new entry, which is then added to the list of entries on the homepage.
- Deleting a Journal Entry: Allows users to delete a journal entry, removing it from the list of entries on the homepage.
- Data Persistence: Saves journal entries locally in the browser's storage for easy access, even after closing the website.
- Responsive Design: Ensures the website works well and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
